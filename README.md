# Classification Algorithms GUI

This repository provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for executing various classification algorithms on a dataset. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. 
You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dzaja123/classification-algorithms-gui.git
cd classification-algorithms-gui
```

## Install the Required Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage:
Run the application by executing the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

## GUI Overview:
The GUI presents a list of classification algorithms. 
Clicking on any algorithm button will execute that specific algorithm on the loaded dataset.

### Algorithms Included:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
